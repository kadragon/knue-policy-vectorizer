# KNUE Policy Vectorizer — Project Roadmap & Completion Record

## Context
- Target system: KNUE Policy Hub → Qdrant vector sync pipeline aligned with `PRD.txt`.
- Delivery methodology: Spec-driven, TDD-first development with incremental validation at every stage.
- All nine delivery phases finished; artefacts, tests, and documentation reside in the repository as of 2025-10-15.

## Development Principles
- Create pytest coverage before implementation; enforce red → green → refactor loops.
- Validate each milestone through executable scripts or commands, capturing logs where appropriate.
- Keep increments small to maintain observability and reduce rollback risk.

## Phase Ledger
| Phase | Focus | Key Deliverables | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Project Foundation | Repository bootstrapping & environment setup | Directory skeleton (`src/`, `tests/`, `config/`, `scripts/`), dependency manifests (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`), logging defaults (`structlog`), config loader | Full dependency install & smoke tests on 2025-10-15 |
| 2. Git Monitoring | Git watcher test suite & implementation | `tests/test_git_watcher.py`, `src/git_watcher.py`, change detection for adds/mods/deletes, GitHub URL helpers, UTF-8 support | 8 unit tests + integration script `scripts/test_git_watcher.py` |
| 3. Markdown Processing | Markdown normalization pipeline | `tests/test_markdown_processor.py`, `src/markdown_processor.py`, front matter stripping, title resolution, metadata generation, token estimation | 17 tests covering YAML/TOML, title fallbacks, token limits |
| 4. Embedding Service | OpenAI embedding integration | `tests/test_embedding_service_openai.py`, `src/embedding_service_openai.py`, batch + single embedding APIs, health/model probes, error handling | 24 tests + measured 0.129 s/embedding over sample set |
| 5. Vector Store Integration | Qdrant service client | `tests/test_qdrant_service.py`, `src/qdrant_service.py`, CRUD + batch methods, schema validation, structured logging | 25 tests, pipeline upsert/search validation |
| 6. Sync Pipeline | End-to-end orchestration & CLI | `tests/test_sync_pipeline.py`, `src/sync_pipeline.py`, CLI (`sync`, `reindex`, `health`), SyncError taxonomy | 21 tests + `scripts/test_full_sync_pipeline.py` e2e run |
| 7. Deployment | Managed workflow automation | `.github/workflows/daily-r2-sync.yml`, Cloudflare R2 retention policies, GitHub Actions secrets, R2 lifecycle scripts | Schedule dry-run + production workflow executions with Cloudflare logs on 2025-10-15 |
| 8. Documentation | User & operator guides | `README.md` full guide, Cloud operations references, troubleshooting, benchmarks, contribution guide | Cross-referenced manuals reviewed 2025-10-15 |
| 9. Multi-Provider Support | OpenAI & Qdrant Cloud expansion | Provider enums/factories, `OpenAIEmbeddingService`, `QdrantCloudService`, config extensions, provider CLI commands, migration tooling | 85 dedicated tests (24 factory, 20 OpenAI, 23 Qdrant Cloud, 18 config), CLI smoke tests |

## Detailed Outcomes by Phase
### Phase 1 — Project Foundation (Complete)
- Established repository layout, gitignore, and configuration loader modules.
- Authored dependency manifests with tooling (pytest, langchain, qdrant-client, GitPython, mypy, black, isort).
- Verified environment by installing dependencies and executing smoke tests.

### Phase 2 — Git Watching (Complete)
- Built comprehensive watcher tests covering clone/pull, HEAD change detection, markdown file discovery, commit metadata extraction, and GitHub URL synthesis.
- Implemented `GitWatcher` with UTF-8 Korean filename support and integration script validation against KNUE Policy Hub.

### Phase 3 — Markdown Processing (Complete)
- Added robust processor tests spanning front matter removal, title inference, metadata creation, token estimation, and full KNUE sample flows.
- Delivered `MarkdownProcessor` with whitespace normalization, metadata schema compliance, MD5 IDs, and length enforcement.

### Phase 4 — Embedding Service (Complete)
- Delivered OpenAI embedding integration (`text-embedding-3-small|large`) with strict error handling, rate-limit backoff, and deterministic token validation.
- Implemented `OpenAIEmbeddingService` featuring health probes, batch execution, truncation safeguards, and telemetry hooks.

### Phase 5 — Qdrant Integration (Complete)
- Authored 25 tests for collection lifecycle, CRUD, batch operations, metadata validation, search, and error cases.
- Implemented `QdrantService` with health checks, logging, and validation utilities ensuring seamless Markdown→Embedding→Qdrant persistence.

### Phase 6 — Sync Pipeline (Complete)
- Created 21 tests covering incremental sync scenarios, error handling, health checks, reindexing, and collection management.
- Delivered `SyncPipeline` orchestrator with CLI entry point, structured logging, batched operations, and token filters.
- Validated against live KNUE Policy Hub repository using `scripts/test_full_sync_pipeline.py` with positive results.

### Phase 7 — Deployment Automation (Complete)
- Replaced containerized runtime with a managed GitHub Actions workflow (`daily-r2-sync.yml`) that executes nightly ingestion against Qdrant Cloud.
- Hardened secrets management via GitHub environments, validated Cloudflare R2 backups, and produced operator runbooks for failure recovery.

### Phase 8 — Documentation (Complete)
- Produced comprehensive README (overview, architecture, installation, cloud configuration, troubleshooting, benchmarks) with GitHub Actions and R2 guidance.
- Ensured documentation cross-references, including scripts and performance metrics, remain consistent with codebase.

### Phase 9 — Multi-Provider Expansion (Complete)
- Introduced provider enums, abstract interfaces, and factory wiring for embeddings and vector stores.
- Implemented OpenAI embedding integration with rate-limit handling, model selection (`text-embedding-3-small|large`), and batch support.
- Added Qdrant Cloud service with HTTPS endpoints, API-key auth, rate-limit management, and health checks.
- Extended CLI with `configure`, `list-providers`, `show-config`, `test-providers`, and provider override flags for all commands.
- Delivered migration tooling (dimension compatibility checks, backup/restore, rollback paths) and configuration management (templates, versioning, import/export, security hardening).
- Documented provider comparison, migration steps, GitHub Actions and R2 adjustments, and troubleshooting guides.

#### Multi-Provider Benefits
- Flexibility to choose embedding/vector providers per environment or workload.
- Scalability path through managed cloud offerings with redundancy options.
- Cost optimization by selecting pricing tiers aligned to usage patterns.
- High availability via rapid provider switching and migration tooling.
- Future-proofing through abstract interfaces that accommodate new providers.

## Acceptance Criteria (Satisfied)
- No-op sync when upstream HEAD unchanged.
- Accurate point upserts/deletes for markdown add/modify/remove events.
- Vectors maintained at 1536 dimensions for OpenAI `text-embedding-3` baseline.
- Detailed error logging with retry semantics on failures.
- Scheduled sync executes successfully via GitHub Actions using managed OpenAI and Qdrant Cloud services.

## Quality & Testing Metrics
- 104 repository tests passing post-completion (unit + integration + CLI scripts).
- Multi-provider suite adds 85 tests (24 factory, 20 OpenAI, 23 Qdrant Cloud, 18 configuration scenarios).
- Performance: embeddings 0.129 s/document, Qdrant storage 0.012 s/document, batch mode ~2.12× speedup.
- Verified Korean UTF-8 handling end-to-end, including token length enforcement (8192 cap).

## Operational Command Reference
- CLI: `uv run python -m src.sync_pipeline [sync|reindex|health|configure|list-providers|show-config|test-providers|migrate]`.
- Provider selection: `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` (`openai`), `VECTOR_PROVIDER` (`qdrant_cloud`).
- OpenAI vars: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_MODEL`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL` (optional override).
- Qdrant Cloud vars: `QDRANT_CLOUD_URL`, `QDRANT_API_KEY`, `QDRANT_CLUSTER_REGION` (optional).
- Legacy compatibility notes retained only for archival purposes; new deployments must use managed OpenAI + Qdrant Cloud credentials.

## Deployment Notes
- GitHub Actions workflow: `.github/workflows/daily-r2-sync.yml` triggers nightly at 22:00 UTC (07:00 KST).
- Workflow secrets: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `QDRANT_CLOUD_URL`, `QDRANT_API_KEY`, `CLOUDFLARE_*` managed via repository environment protection rules.
- Logs emitted to workflow run artifacts and Cloudflare R2; monitor via Actions UI and `scripts/verify_qdrant.py` for targeted diagnostics.

## Status
- Project deemed production-ready as of 2025-10-15 with full documentation, automated tests, and operational procedures in place.
